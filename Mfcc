Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)

MFCCs are derived as follows:

1. Take the Fourier transform of (a windowed excerpt of) a signal.
2. Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale,
using triangular overlapping windows.
3. Take the logs of the powers at each of the mel frequencies.
4. Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers, as if it
were a signal.
5. The MFCCs are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum.


Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function.

The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties
of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment.
It’s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1,
but never exactly at those limits.

1 / (1 + e^-value)

Where e is the base of the natural logarithms (Euler’s number or the EXP() function in your spreadsheet)
and value is the actual numerical value that you want to transform.
Below is a plot of the numbers between -5 and 5 transformed into the range 0 and 1 using the logistic function.
